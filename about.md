title: about me
---

I am fascinated by systems of things – living systems, political & social systems, computational systems, and systems of language. Many of my posts on this website (will) consist of my subjective attempts to isolate and extrapolate on common themes that I’ve observed throughout these systems. The question is often whether or not I have the willpower to write everything down. ☺

I am also an avid writer in my spare time, and am especially fond of writing Shakespearean sonnets, poetry, science fiction, and essays on things I've observed. When I’m not writing, I am taking photographs, reading about neuroscience, worldbuilding, making lists of things, studying foreign languages, discovering new music, or trying to learn something new.

I am currently an undergraduate student at Stanford University, where I am happily majoring in Symbolic Systems. I work as a programmer in the Virtual Human Interaction Lab.

Feel free to email me [here](mailto:smaples@stanford.edu) – we’d probably get along! Thanks for visiting!
