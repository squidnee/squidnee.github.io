title: About Me
---

I'm a current undergrad at Stanford University, majoring in Symbolic Systems. I like reading, writing, photography, coding, and thinking about people and their brains. I also like creating lists for obscure things that interest me.

Life is a lot of fun -- I'm glad I'm finally tall enough for the ride!
