I am a student in the [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/ssp_description) program at Stanford University, where I work co-currently as a researcher and research assistant in the [Stanford Mood & Anxiety Disorders Laboratory](http://web.stanford.edu/group/mood/). I am also the photography director for a student publication called [MINT Magazine](https://issuu.com/mint_magazine) as well as the leader of the Technical Team for [CS + Mental Health](http://csplusmh.com/), a Stanford initiative that seeks to work alongside mental healthcare researchers and professionals in order to develop and deploy mental healthcare technology.

In general, I am obsessed with thinking about how people think. More specifically, I am interested in how cognitive and biological processes shape both societies and individuals. My motivations expose an underlying devotion to the idea that natural systems shape other systems, and I enjoy exploring this through journalism and through data-driven projects. My [blog posts](http://sydneymaples.com/archives.html) and [programming projects](http://sydneymaples.com/projects.html) serve as my passive attempts to document this.

Outside of the above, I am interested in [creative writing](http://sydneymaples.com/poems.html), [making lists of things I like](http://sydneymaples.com/lists.html), classic rock, worldbuilding, fractal-like things, [brain teasers](http://www.braingle.com), words (especially names, or even [words that could be names](http://sydneymaples.com/lists.html)), finding neat facts about birds, and fruitlessly attempting to justify my love for metaphysics.
