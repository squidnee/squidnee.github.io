I am a student in the [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/ssp_description) program at Stanford University, where I work co-currently as a programmer in the [Virtual Human Interaction Lab](https://vhil.stanford.edu/mission/). I am also the leader of the Technical Team for [CS + Mental Health](http://csplusmh.com/), a Stanford initiative that seeks to work alongside mental healthcare researchers and professionals in order to develop and deploy mental healthcare technology.

In general, I am interested in how cognitive and biological processes shape societies and cultures. My motivations expose an underlying devotion to the idea that natural systems shape other systems, and I enjoy exploring this through journalism and through data-driven projects. My [blog posts](http://sydneymaples.com/archives.html) and [programming projects](http://sydneymaples.com/projects.html) serve as my passive attempts to document this.

Outside of the above, I am interested in [creative writing](http://sydneymaples.com/poems.html), [photography](http://sydneymaples.com/photography.html), computational psychiatry, classic rock, philosophy and history of science, fashion, brain teasers, foreign languages, and fruitlessly attempting to justify my love for metaphysics.
