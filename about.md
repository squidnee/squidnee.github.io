title: about me
---

I am a student in the [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/ssp_description) program at Stanford University, where I work co-currently as a programmer in the [Virtual Human Interaction Lab](https://vhil.stanford.edu/mission/). I invest the majority of my mental effort on the cognitive and social sciences in order to seek practical solutions to social problems. In particular, I am interested in making explicit the implicit roles of mental processes and cultural formalities, and looking for effective ways to redirect and cultivate a ‘best possible’ society. I enjoy doing this through journalism and through data-driven projects, and my [blog posts](http://sydneymaples.com/archives.html) and [programming projects](http://sydneymaples.com/projects.html) on this website serve to reflect this.

My motivations expose an underlying devotion to the idea that natural systems govern other systems. One relevant example is the system of ‘culture’, which can ultimately be traced back to our ‘biology’ (our natural system). The human brain is a biologically-informed structure that is made surprisingly accessible through introspection, and as such it is my belief that a thorough understanding of the human mind serves as a reliable guide towards an understanding and reformation of human culture, with an additional understanding of how to make technology more authentically intelligent. In my off time, I enjoy exploring this notion further in creative works of [poetry](http://sydneymaples.com/poems.html) and [photography](http://sydneymaples.com/photography.html).

Outside of the above, I am interested in computational psychiatry, classic rock, ontology and epistemology, fashion, brain teasers, and foreign languages. [Send me an email](mailto:smaples@stanford.edu) if you’d like to chat! ☺
