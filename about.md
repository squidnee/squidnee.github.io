title: about me
---

I am fascinated by systems of things – living systems, social systems, computational systems, and systems of language. Many of my posts on this website (will) consist of my subjective attempts to isolate and extrapolate on common themes that I’ve observed throughout these systems.

I am also an avid writer in my spare time, and am especially fond of writing Shakespearean sonnets, poetry, creative fiction, and theoretical essays. When I’m not writing, I am taking photographs, reading about neuroscience, collecting and organizing neat things into lists, studying foreign languages, or trying to learn something new. I am also pretty rigorously introspective, and I spend an unfortunately grandiose amount of time thinking about how people work. This website also functions as an outlet for me to do that.

I am currently an undergraduate student at Stanford University, where I am happily majoring in Symbolic Systems, minoring in Biology, and working as a programmer in the Virtual Human Interaction Lab.

Feel free to email me [here](mailto:smaples@stanford.edu) – we’d probably get along! Thanks for visiting, by the way. ☺
