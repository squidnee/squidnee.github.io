      <h1 id="my-solutions-for-low-motivation">My Solutions for Low Motivation</h1>

<p>I perceive the cognitive experience of life as an interesting assortment of methods and heuristics. In struggling with a life-long bout of ADHD, I have learned the following things about the cognition behind my sense of motivation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a) I am largely unmotivated by the act of doing something for the sake of doing it. I find motivation (or, the emotional valence and arousal that leads to motivation) to be very inherent and based on my value system.</li>
  <li>b)	I like the idea of doing something once it is novel, and I find little to no motivation to continue pursuing it once the glossy coating of novelty has been stripped away.</li>
  <li>c)	I gain more from planning to do something than actually doing it. I can only assume that people who achieve for the sake of achieving do so because they gain some sort of happiness from achieving. I gain this same happiness (“dopamine boost”) from planning what I am going to do with my life. I like to call this ‘profiling’ – in planning my life without actually living it, I can create a ‘profile’ of multiple possible identities without limiting myself to one, and I can happily envision myself living each life before the aforementioned coating of novelty wears off.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If motivation is inherent to me, what motivates me?</strong></p>

<p>From observing both b) and c), it appears to me that my motivation comes from (the generation of) ideas. To me, an idea is an implication of something that could be, but currently isn’t. For this reason, it can be stretched to accommodate new sub-ideas before it becomes a physical manifestation, thus increasing the half-life of its perceived ‘novelty’.</p>

<p>When you have an idea, your first instinct is to implement the idea. Once you start implementing the idea, your idea turns into a project. The success of the project (in my world, at least) depends on how closely tied you remain to the idea without losing the hypothetical glossy coating of novelty. This tells us two things:
+ 1)	An effective idea is an idea in which you are responsible for (“your idea”).
+ 2)	The idea must continue to grow in stature so as not to lose its novelty.</p>

<p>Going back to the question of what motivates me, it looks like the primary indicator of how likely (and how efficiently) I will do something is how novel the idea is to me, how “responsible” I am for my “own” idea, and how long the idea remains novel in the long-term.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the academic system is structured in a way that doesn’t live in accordance with the way my motivation works.</p>

<p>First of all, I am given specific assignments to complete by a certain deadline. This violates my internal “value system” (I was given the deadlines, I didn’t impose them on myself), and the specific assignments given to me do not belong to me the way they would have if I had come up with them myself. Therefore, I am less wed to the assignments than I would have been if I had created my own assignments (even if the assignments were the same!).</p>

<p>Second, I am (more often than not) forced to take classes that do not coincide with my interests. With ADHD, you are either “on” or “off” – totally focused, or totally unfocused. In my case, I often find myself rumbling around in my default mode network. This becomes a problem when a necessary math class is required for my major.</p>

<p>Third, I am not a good test taker at all. I find tests to be very hard to take – I run out of time, I start to daydream, I can’t write fast enough, etcetera. On top of that, I get distracted when I study so that I don’t fully learn the material. And because I do not think sequentially (I think globally), if I don’t understand the bigger picture of what is going on, I might as well know nothing.</p>

<p>Given these issues, here are the ways I try to counteract these problems in my academic environment:</p>

<h2 id="solution-one-come-up-with-your-own-schedule"><strong>Solution One: “Come up” with your own schedule.</strong></h2>

<p>This requires nothing but a simple change in semantic interpretation. Instead of saying “I have to do XXX for my CS class”, say “I want to do XXX for my CS class.” Instead of saying “I have to finish XXX by Tuesday”, say “I want to finish XXX by Tuesday.” The idea here is to reduce this feeling of obligation that is associated with required assignments, and to feel like you are coming up with your own ideas and allowing yourself to “create” your own deadlines, rather than feeling like they are being imposed on you.</p>

<p>To further this idea, when you approach each assignment, think about the assignment in terms of a) what you are going to learn from it, and b) if relevant, how you can go one step further and do something really cool with it. The former is a lot easier to utilize for my Math problem sets, and my CS classes work well for the latter, because I’m creating my own idea of what I want my final project to look like (within the guidelines I am given – not that I want to perceive them as being ‘given to me’, of course).</p>

<h2 id="solution-two-keep-a-logbook"><strong>Solution Two: Keep a logbook.</strong></h2>

<p>By this, I mean keep a notebook where you record your ideas. This is a helpful practice for ADHD folk in general, because a logbook allows you to record your thoughts as they come up (so that you don’t have to ruminate them/think through them when you should be doing something else). In using a logbook, I can ask myself questions such as “How can I more efficiently learn how to prove things in CS 103?” or “What kind of extensions could I add to my CS program?” From this, I can generate a list of possibilities underneath. Plus, blank paper is exciting – there is so much possibility in blank space!</p>

<p>Keeping a logbook does three good things. One, it gets me excited to work, because I am doing what motivates me best: generating ideas about how to improve things (namely, my productivity in a particular class). Two, I am associating my classes and workload with ideas, which is a positive association and allows me to view work as a fun way to play with efficiency and self-improvement (which us ADHD folk are huge fans of). Third and finally, I am able to use my divergent thinking style to find more effective ways of learning and processing information.</p>

<h2 id="solution-three-generate-enthusiasm-fake-it-till-you-make-it"><strong>Solution Three: Generate enthusiasm (“fake it ‘till you make it”).</strong></h2>

<p>This is something I’ve been doing every day since I came to Stanford, but I became aware of it only recently. I came into Stanford truly loving very few things apart from aesthetics, creative writing, and how people worked. Now in my second year at Stanford, I have found a newfound love for theoretical Mathematics, data analysis, and a bunch of other traditionally “left-brained” things that I wouldn’t have touched back in high school.</p>

<p>What changed? Well, my attitude certainly did. Perhaps it was a byproduct of my comfort in the environment around me, but I soon found myself approaching everything ahead of me with enthusiasm and a sense of awe. Once I became a bit more self-aware, I started to use this to my advantage. Instead of approaching each class as “I have to take this for my major…”, I approached each class like it was one of the most interesting things in the world. I did this partially by relating it to the broader scope of what I already liked (eg. “I want to learn linear algebra because I want to learn more about neural networks”), and I also partially did this by simply talking about how exciting each class was. If I tell my friends that I love learning set theory, I will eventually start truly loving set theory. Since motivation is inherent, if I can convince myself that I am inherently motivated to learn these things, then I will take the time to learn them.</p>

<h2 id="solution-four-talk-about-what-you-are-doing-with-others"><strong>Solution Four: Talk about what you are doing with others.</strong></h2>

<p>Support is always a good thing, and when people support your ideas, you are incentivized to keep working on them. The positive feedback is a good enough “dopamine boost” to replace the planning stage. Also, if you continuously tell people what you are planning on doing, it indirectly encourages you to keep doing it, because the idea becomes more a “part of you”.</p>

<p>Some people find this to work in the opposite direction (i.e. with negative consequences), and I’m not entirely sure why. However, I do not doubt that this method wouldn’t work for everyone.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In conclusion, I have found that the following methods work for me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Come up with your “own” schedule instead of allowing assignments and deadlines to be imposed on you by others. This appeals to a more subjective sense of motivation.</li>
  <li>Keep a logbook of ideas and ways to improve how you learn. This allows you to surround yourself with ideas (which are good), and associating them with work (which then leads us to believe that work is good).</li>
  <li>Generate your own enthusiasm about the topics you are learning. Again, this appeals to a subjective sense of motivation. Also, maintaining a constant sense of awe allows you to continuously see what you are learning as novel.</li>
  <li>Talk about what you are learning/planning on doing with others. The positive feedback and/or discussion might increase the value of what you are doing, thus incentivizing you to work on it continuously.</li>
