    {"name":"Left temporoparietal junction","description":"Reduced blood flow in the temporoparietal junction is correlated with an inability for an Alzheimer’s patient to perceive herself as others do (from a third-person perspective). As the disease progresses, the patient is unable to understand the extent of his or her cognitive decline. In addition, the TPJ contains something called a “praxicon”, which is a sort of dictionary of different human actions. The decline of the TPJ leads to an inability of an Alzheimer’s patient to discern between his or her own actions and those of others."},

    {"name":"Thalamus","description":"The volume of the thalamus is strongly reduced in those with Alzheimer’s disease. The thalamus is important for generating attention and for recalling facts and verbal knowledge, and since it is smaller in those with Alzheimer’s, there is a decreased ability to pay attention or recall factual and verbal information in those with the disease."},

    {"name":"Left inferotemporal cortex"},
    {"name":"Right inferotemporal cortex","description":"A clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s requires the presence of memory impairment, but is often also accompanied by issues relating to at least one other cognitive function of the brain, such as visual processing, spatial thinking, or the ability to use language. Those with visuospatial impairment have been shown to have significantly less grey matter in the right inferotemporal cortex, and this decrease in grey matter often acts as a predictor of amnesia and Alzheimer’s disease. Those with Alzheimer’s who do not have problems with visuospatial recognition do not have this decrease in grey matter."},

    {"name":"Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex"},
    {"name":"Right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex","description":"There is increased connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with Alzheimer’s. This has been interpreted as the brain’s way of compensating for decreased cognitive performance."},

    {"name":"Left putamen","description":"There is a considerable decrease in putamen volume in those with Alzheimer’s, which appears to be directly linked to the volume of the neocortex. The neocortex is responsible for higher level cognitive functioning, abstract reasoning, and rational decision making. As the volume of the neocortex decreases, so does the volume of the putamen, leading the Alzheimer’s patient to struggle with higher-level reasoning and critical thinking skills."},

    {"name":"Left temporal gyrus","description":"The temporal gyrus area plays a key role in “semantic memory”, or memory for things that are common knowledge, such as the names of colors, the sounds of letters, the names of cities, and so on. When this area is damaged, the patient is no longer able to remember basic facts acquired over time. Deficits in the temporal gyrus may contribute to a loss of semantic memory in Alzheimer’s patients."},

    {"name":"Posterior cingulate cortex (precuneus)","description":"All patients with Alzheimer’s disease were found to have disrupted functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and default mode network regions, which worsened as the Alzheimer’s became more severe. Interestingly, decreased blood flow in the PCC/precuneus area is also evident in participants at genetic risk for developing Alzheimer's disease."},
    {"name":"Left hippocampus","description":"There is increased connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with Alzheimer’s. This has been interpreted as the brain’s way of compensating for decreased cognitive performance."},
    {"name":"Right hippocampus","description":"Those with Alzheimer’s show a severe shrinkage in the hippocampus, which is responsible for memory formation and learning."},

    {"name":"Left orbitofrontal cortex"},
    {"name":"Right orbitofrontal cortex"},
    {"name":"Medial prefrontal cortex","description":"The medial PFC is one of the last brain regions to deteriorate in those with Alzheimer’s. This region is linked to the ability to recall familiar music. Up until late-stage Alzheimer’s, those with the disease are able to sing along to and remember familiar songs, even songs from their youth. Sometimes, familiar music can help a patient remember a specific memory or emotion associated with the song."},

    {"name":"Left temporal cortex","description":"The temporal cortex aids in memory recall, which is damaged in those with Alzheimer’s disease. Those with Alzheimer’s have much fewer synapses in the temporal cortex than normal, with up to 25% fewer synapses than the average person without Alzheimer’s. This loss typically happens at an early stage of the disease, and is hypothesized to play a fundamental role in the progression of the disease."},
