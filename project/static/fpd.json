    {"name":"Left anterior insula","description":"There is a shrinkage of the anterior insula in those with frontotemporal dementia (particularly in the variant of FTD known as the ‘behavioral variant’). This leads a patient’s inability to model the emotional impact of his or her own actions."},

    {"name":"Left amygdala","description":"There are several different variants of frontotemporal dementia. One variant is known as ‘temporal variant frontotemporal dementia’ (tvFTD), and is associated with a shrinkage in the amygdala. Compared to the average person, a patient with tvFTD has a harder time with emotional comprehension, particularly with negative emotions. This is always accompanied by shrinkage in the left side of the amygdala, and less so with the right side – though shrinkage in both contributes to more severe problems with regulating emotion."},
    {"name":"Right amygdala"},
    {"name":"Anterior cingulate cortex","description":"Those with FTD often have trouble with tasks that involve resolving conflict and making decisions. This has been shown to be associated with dysfunction in the anterior cingulate cortex."},

    {"name":"Right ventral striatum"},
    {"name":"Thalamus","description":"There is a shrinkage of the thalamus in those with frontotemporal dementia (particularly in the variant of FTD known as the ‘behavioral variant’). The thalamus is highly linked to the limbic system, which controls and mediates emotion. Thus, a shrinkage in the thalamus leads a patient to display apathy, or loss of emotion."},

    {"name":"Left caudate","description":"With the shrinkage of the thalamus comes inevitable shrinkage of the caudate in certain subtypes of frontotemporal dementia, which further leads to apathy and decreased cognitive functioning. The caudate nucleus is supposedly responsive to visual beauty, and has been suggested to be one of the neural correlates of “romantic love”. Responsiveness to visual beauty declines over time in certain subtypes of FTD. In addition, the caudate interacts with the basal ganglia, which helps with motor control. With deterioration of the caudate comes inevitable tremors, restlessness, and muscular rigidity in those with FTD."},

    {"name":"Ventromedial prefrontal cortex","description":"The ventromedial PFC is an early marker of FTD, as it produces the behaviors commonly associated with FTD (such as disinhibition, overeating, apathy, or lack of empathy or sympathy for others)."},
    {"name":"Left orbitofrontal cortex","description":"The disease begins in the orbitofrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, this is a primary area for detection in FTD. There is an increasing interest in using neuropsychological tests, such as the Iowa gambling task or Faux Pas Recognition test as an alternative to imaging for FTD. These tests are particularly sensitive to the orbitofrontal cortex. This area is also heavily associated with difficulties with suppressing inappropriate behaviors in those with the disease."},
